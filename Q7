You are working on a digital library system where each book is represented as a node in a doubly linked list. The library system needs a feature to display all the books available from the first book to the last book in the order they are stored. You need to implement the dll_forward_display() function that will receive the starting node of the doubly linked list and print the titles of the books from the first book to the last book.

Input Format
First Line of Input consists of Integer,Number of books
Next Line of Input consists of String,Name of the Books

Output Format
Display the titles of the books from the first book to the last book.

Sample Input:
2
Connect the Dots
The Person who moved My Cheese

Sample Output:
Connect the Dots
The Person who moved My Cheese


SOLUTION:


class Node:
    def __init__(self,data):
        self.data=data
        self.next=None
        self.prev=None
class DoublyLinkedlist:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head=None
        #inset at the end
    def insert_at_the_end(self,data):
        new_node=Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head=new_node
            return
        current=self.head
        while(current.next):
            current=current.next
        current.next=new_node
        new_node.prev=current
    def print_list(self):
        current=self.head
        while(current):
            print(current.data)
            current=current.next  
#main program
dll=DoublyLinkedlist()
n=int(input())
for i in range(n):
    title=input()
    dll.insert_at_the_end(title)
dll.print_list()
